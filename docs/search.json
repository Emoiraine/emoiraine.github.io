    "text": "When archiving or tracking data in the office we want to be able to allow team leaders to easily add or remove people as they come and go. They often have to update or change the type of tasks they are tracking as well, all of which means you have Joe Schmo, making changes to documents and records in your data.\nWe all know that Array formulas allow us to run a single function on thousands of rows at a time. Saving valuable run time and preventing a lot of data deletion and error. Where this saves us, it still means we have to place the formula on a vulnerable line, or so I thought. I thought I had to put my column names in row 1 and my formula in row 2, that also has an employee attached for tracking. If a team leader needed to remove or replace them, more often than not they delete the line or clear it to add a new person or just remove them permanently.\nIt’s super simple but has been appreciated by many in my department as well as team members as we work with their teams. You can place your Array formulas in your column headers. Normally you would have something like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nDate\nUser\nAccounts Added to Login Manager\n\n\n\n\n1\n01/01/2022\neshaw\n\\[=ArrayFormula(IF(B2:B=\"\",\"\",COUNTIFS(ACCOUNTS!E:E,C2:C,ACCOUNTS!B:B,B2:B)))\\]\n\n\n1\n01/01/2022\nhess\n32\n\n\n\nYou can do this instead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nDate\nUser\n={“Accounts Added to Login Manager”;ArrayFormula(IF(B2:B=““,”“,COUNTIFS(ACCOUNTS!E:E,C2:C,ACCOUNTS!B:B,B2:B)))\n\n\n\n\n1\n01/01/2022\neshaw\n54\n\n\n1\n01/01/2022\nhess\n32\n\n\n\nWhat they see is\n\n\n\nWeek\nDate\nUser\nAccounts Added to Login Manager\n\n\n\n\n1\n01/01/2022\neshaw\n54\n\n\n1\n01/01/2022\nhess\n32\n\n\n\nAnd now if eshaw is no longer on the team or with the company, anybody can come in to remove or replace them without completely removing the formula and data for all the others below them.\n\n\n\nHow can I calculate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts."
