##Who am I?
I am currently a Data Analyst for Conservice. I've helped Coordinate complete data restructure over 12+ teams and created templates for accurate data archives as well as new tracking tools utilizing:

*Programs such as - Google Sheets,Google Colab,Excel, and Power Bi
*Languages such as - Google App Script/JavaScript and Python

I also created high level summaries and data visualizations for the CFO to analyze team production, accuracy, prioritize tasks, and visualize corporate profits and losses.

##What's this Blog about?

I struggled so you don't have to. I will be updating and sharing functions, templates, scripts, and codes. What worked for me and what didn't. I'll be sharing all the tips and tricks I discovered along the way and know I can apply them to future projects along the way.
